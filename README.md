This package is part of the [Apie](https://github.com/apie-lib) library.

## Documentation
Apie project starter. This is the easiest way to start working with Apie! It uses the create-project option of Composer and will ask you a few questions for configuration.

## Installing with composer create-project
The easiest solution is to use composer create-project:

```
composer create-project apie/apie-project-starter app -s dev
```
This creates a new Apie application in app. When you run this it will ask a few questions, like do you want to use Symfony or
Laravel and how much should be added.

## Installing without composer create-project
You can clone this repo and just call:
```
bin/start-project start-project
```
Afterwards you still need to run composer install to install the vendor libraries.

## Running the created project with development settings (Symfony)
If you picked Symfony or just skipped the question it will install Symfony as framework. 
You can follow the instructions on how to run a dev server in the Symfony documentation:
https://symfony.com/doc/current/setup/symfony_server.html

## Configuring database connections (Symfony)
By default the starter is configured to install everything in a sqlite file. If you want to change this open
config/apie.yaml and look for the section with doctrine, connection_params. The available options are the same as
the [doctrine bundle DBAL configuration](https://symfony.com/doc/current/reference/configuration/doctrine.html).

## Running the created project with development settings (Laravel)
If you picked Laravel it will install Laravel as framework. You can start a test server by filling in the terminal
```
./artisan serve
```
## Configuring database connections (Laravel)
By default the starter is configured to install everything in a sqlite file. If you want to change this open
config/apie.php and look for the section with doctrine, connection_params. The available options are the same as
the [doctrine bundle DBAL configuration](https://symfony.com/doc/current/reference/configuration/doctrine.html).

## Editing/modifying the project starter
You can checkout this repo and test the create-project functionality with make and running this
```
make test-project
```

It will create/replace the application in the folder test-project. Most files are generated by Symfony flex or by the console command by reading twig templates.
